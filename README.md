# Occupancy Grid Mapping using Kinect
This project is part of the Autonomous Systems course from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. 

The main goal of this project is to implement the Occupancy Grid Mapping algorithm and estimate, accurately, maps from different divisions using the Microsoft Kinect depth camera and the Pioneer-3DX.

# How to run the code
To run this implementation of the Occupancy Grid Mapping you need to:

- Install and run libfreenect package
  - roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch
  
- Install Depthimage_to_laserscan package
  - use the launch file depthtolaser.launch (or modify it accordingly)
  - use the cfg file Depth.cfg (or modify it accordingly)
  
 # How to improve the results
 This algorithm is using the Pioneer-3DX odometry to get the robot pose.
 Since the odometry accumulates error over time, you should use GMapping to create a map and then use AMCL package to get a better robot localization.
  - Install GMapping package
    - use the launch file slam_gmapping_pr2.launch
  - Install AMCL package
    - use the amcl_diff.launch
